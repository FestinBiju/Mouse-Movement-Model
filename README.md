# Human-like Mouse Movement Simulation

This repository contains Python code for simulating human-like mouse movements using a Linear Regression model.

## Overview

The code generates synthetic mouse movement data, trains a Linear Regression model on this data, and then simulates mouse movements based on the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-like-mouse-movement.git
   cd human-like-mouse-movement

python mouse_movement_simulation.py
This will train the Linear Regression model, simulate mouse movements, and visualize the movements in a plot.
